_Teaching a car to drive_

### **Project Overview**

This project contains the results from completing Project 3 of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to teach a convolutional neural net to drive a car, using only video of humans driving as input.

#### Files in the repository
* The code for the model and training procedure - [model.py](./model.py)
* A trained model - [model.h5](./model.h5)
* The code that makes the driver drive - [drive.py](./drive.py)
* The videos recording autonomous laps around [track 1](./video.mp4) and [track 2](./track2.mp4)
* A [writeup](./WRITEUP.md) detailing the results of the project

#### Running the code
This project was developed using Python 3.5. The project depends on the [NumPY](http://www.numpy.org/), [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) libraries.
